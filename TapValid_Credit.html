    <h4 style="color: darkred; text-align:center;">BASIC REBUTTAL</h4>
    <p><em>(Donor simply says no, gives no reason or any reason not mentioned below)</em></p>
    <p>
      I completely understand. It does show here you've previously used a card, We just ask everyone to use a card because it's a faster
       and more cost effective way to accept donations for the 
      <b>(VETERANS/FIREFIGHTERS/OFFICERS)</b> and your donation can go to work immediately.
      <br><br>
     <b> Can you use a card just one time?</b>
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote style="text-align:left; display:inline-block; max-width:700px;">
    <h4 style="color: darkred; text-align:center;">SAFETY REBUTTAL</h4>
    <p><em>(To use when a customer says they are not comfortable using a card for safety reasons — had their number stolen, doesn’t feel safe giving it on the phone, does not trust it, etc.)</em></p>
    <p>
      I completely understand, please keep in mind you've used a card previously, as you may remember we would never take the 
      security code off the back of the card and that’s done for your safety.
    
      Also, your information is never stored and this charge would show up as the <b>(LISTDESCRIPTION)</b> so you know exactly who you're giving to.
  
      That being said, would you be able to use your card to assist the <b>(officers/veterans/firefighters)</b> just this one time?
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote style="text-align:left; display:inline-block; max-width:700px;">
    <h4 style="color: darkred; text-align:center;">WANTS MAIL REBUTTAL</h4>
    <p><em>(Use when a customer says they want something in the mail only)</em></p>
    <p>
      Well you did use a card previously, and would still of course receive your receipt in the mail even if you use your card, 
      along with the thank you letter from the organization.
      By using a card it will help provide immediate help to the <b>(VETERANS/FIREFIGHTERS/OFFICERS)</b>.
      <br><br>
      <b>So can they count on you to make your donation now, just this one time?</b>
