        <h4>❌ IF NO — Go to Rebuttals</h4>
        I completely understand. If we mail you a receipt, can the organization count on you to mail back a check or money order?

          <b>IF YES:</b> Thank you so much! Have a great day.<br><br>
          <b>IF NO or not comfortable:</b> Drop donation level until the customer is comfortable.
