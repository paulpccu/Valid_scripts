      I completely understand, please keep in mind you've used a card previously, as you may remember we would never take the

      Also, your information is never stored and this charge would show up as <b>(LISTDESCRIPTION)</b> so you know exactly who you're giving to.
  
      That being said, would you be able to use your card to assist the <b>(officers/veterans/firefighters)</b> just this one time?
